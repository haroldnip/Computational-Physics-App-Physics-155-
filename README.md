# Computational-Physics-App-Physics-155-
This repository is for an undergraduate computational physics course. We used Python programming language in Physics problem solving.
Exercises from Computational Physics by Mark Newmann were solved. Most notes are from App Physics 155 class of UP Diliman, 1st semester 23-24. Lab instructors are Adrian Chester Balingit and Louie John Rubio. Lecture is handled by Dr. May T. Lim. 

We have used Python as the programming language.
